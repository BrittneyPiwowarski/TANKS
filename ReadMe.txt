For this project, I decided to use the one of the project tutorials off of the unity website and add my own ideas to it. This tanks game
incorperated multiplayer, lighting, audio mixing, and other aspects in Unity.

I decided to add my own flare and make this a winter tanks game rather than a dessert game. I changed all of the materials, created my own low-poly
pine trees using blender, and worked with lighting to change the atmosphere.

I also tried to make this work with networked multiplayer without any luck. I was able to get the two players to move but I had a lot of 
issues/headaches with the shooting aspects of the game. If nothing else, it was a good life lesson that multiplayer is very hard. Therefore,
this project only includes local multiplayer but I thought I would throw in a comment about it.

Very fun project though. I had a lot of fun working with blender.
